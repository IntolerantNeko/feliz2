					Feliz
					-----
The Feliz scripts make installation of Arch Linux quick and easy.

1) Feliz can be run from an iso available at:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/feliz ... and ...
	https://github.com/angeltoast/feliz/releases
   Burn the iso to a CD or USB stick, or run it directly in Virtualbox.
   It starts a live session of Arch Linux, and runs the script.
   All you have to do is follow the prompts.
   Feliz always downloads the latest scripts from Github at the start of each installation,
   so you don't need to replace your Feliz iso every time there's a new release.

2) Alternatively, you can run Feliz by downloading the initialising script from Github into a running
   live Arch Linux session.
   Here's how to do it:
     1) Download Arch Linux from ... https://www.archlinux.org/download/
     2) Either:
	(a) Burn the Arch iso image to a usb stick as described here:
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media
			... or...
   	(b) To test in Virtualbox or other virtualising system, add the iso as a disk
     3) Start your Arch session, then when you have the root prompt, enter the following:
	pacman -Sy unzip
     4) Next enter:
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeltoast/feliz-init/master/felizinit-stable
     5) Now enter: chmod +x felizinit-stable
     6) Then start Feliz by entering: ./felizinit-stable

3) Feliz has helpful on-screen advice at every stage, guiding you through the entering of such essential data
   as your location, username, etc, offering you a host of extras from the official Arch repos (like desktop
   environments, web browsers, office software and programming tools) and working with you to set up your
   partitioning. Then everything rolls along automatically, displaying all output on the screen, so you can see
   exactly what the installer is doing - just like a manual installation.

4) Partitioning
   Feliz used to offer tools to modify existing partitions and create new partitions.
   However, there have recently been serious problems with this code, so those options have been removed until the
   bugs can be fixed.
   There is now a file with advice about partitioning ... partitioning ... which can be read during installation.

And, finally, an anouncement from the creator of Feliz. I am not sure how much longer I will be able to maintain Feliz, so I hope that many people will clone Feliz and release their own versions to keep the dream alive.
